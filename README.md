# Genetic-Algorithm-MATLAB
GA_Version_1 -- Demonstrates solution to a two variable design problem. Useful as a HW for a graduate level course or developing more robust Genetic Algorithms

GA_Version_2 -- To be uploaded, will be able to solve N variable problem in standard optimization form, can choose between one or two cross over operator, bit-flip mutation, for 2 variable and 3 variable problem, show convergence to known optimum location
